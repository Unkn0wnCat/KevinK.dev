aboutText: I am Kevin Kandlbinder, a developer and hobby photographer from northern germany. I've learned operating computers very early in my life with my father giving me his old Windows 2000 tower. Some years later I've had my first contact with web development a few years later when I bought a book about HTML, PHP, JavaScript and CSS from a sale at my local library. From this point onwards web development has been a job and a hobby equally.
